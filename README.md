# plot-chaos
Plots the Logistic Map, Liapunov Exponent, and Cobweb Diagrams.

An extremely simple implementation which generates the Bifurcation Diagram for the Logistic map, Liapunov Exponent as a function of the growth parameter for the Logistic Map, and the Cobweb Diagram for the Logistic Map.

## How to use
Change the parameters defined in the _params_ folder in the plot's corresponding parameter file (filename is _plot_params.py_).
Run the main file and enter which plot has to be generated and the familiar matplotlib interface opens with the plot.
